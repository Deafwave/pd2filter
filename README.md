1. Open your text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, etc) as Administrator
1. With your text editor open **default.filter** from your ProjectD2 folder

1. Save and close the file
1. Open Project Diablo 2
1. Once in-game CTRL+click the Settings button (bottom-left corner by default)
1. Change your settings to match the image below
1. Close the Settings window by right-clicking in the title bar (anywhere along the bar that says "Settings")
1. Reload your filter using **Numpad 0**
   1. If you don't have a numpad change `Reload Config:          VK_NUMPAD0` in ProjectDiablo.cfg (in your PD2 folder) to one of these [Virtual Key Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)

If it worked a Minor Health Potion should now say *HP1*.

# Loot Filters
### [Detailed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/detailed.filter)
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.

**Select this version if you are uncomfortable with needing to write your own filter lines.** This version has lines for every single item in the game and is **massively** commented to make it very, very easy to edit to your liking. This is for ease-of-use and very quick editing as you should ideally only ever have to comment or uncomment a line (add or remove //). This version will show and notify a lot of items by default with the idea that you can slowly start to comment out things you don't need. The flip side is that since this filter contains lines for every item you can easily just uncomment a line for things you want to show that aren't currently showing.

### [Compact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/compact.filter)
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.

**Select this version if you are comfortable with writing your own filter lines.** This version will contain only the lines that are already uncommented in the Detailed version. This version will still show and notify a lot of items that you can slowly start to comment out but you have to have knowledge of filters to add your own lines for items that are not already in the filter.

### [Basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/basic.filter)
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.

**Select this version if you want a template/base to start from for creating your own filter.** This filters purpose is to help people get a start on building their own filter. No support will be given for this filter, you assume all responsibility for creating and editing it to your liking.

### Wolfie
**N/A yet.** This version is basically a copy of my own personal filter. Will most likely contain things you don't think are worth it and not contain things you think are worth it. No support will be given for this version.

* All ears

* Rare items you don't specify past a certain character level
* Magic items you don't specify past a certain character level
* White items with 1 socket past a certain character level
* White Amazon Javelins past certain character levels (no sockets so no Runewords possible)
* White Amazon Javelins that are only +0-2 Jav skills past a certain character level
* White Belts, Boots, and Gloves past certain character levels
* White Bucklers (and Exceptional version) past certain character levels as they can only have 1 socket (no Runewords)
* White Daggers and Dirks (and Exceptional & Elite versions) pastcertain character levels as they can only have 1 socket (no Runewords)

# Disclaimer
For all versions of the filter I take no responsibility for any items that are accidentally hidden and/or do not notify. I do try my best to test these filters and ensure they are working properly but there's always room for error.
